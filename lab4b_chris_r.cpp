/* Write a program to solve quadratic equations, it should test to see if the equation has a solution or not.
The user will type in 3 numbers a, b and c representing the coefficients.
The program will test to see if the discriminant (b2 - 4ac) is negative, zero or positive.
If negative, there is no solution.
If zero, output the unique solution of â€“b/2a.
If positive, output the two different solutions.
If a is zero, it is not a quadratic equation.
